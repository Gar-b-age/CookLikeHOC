## Ingredients

- Bang Bang Shrimp (South American White Shrimp) (Rongcheng Huangchao Mahan)
- Shortening (for puffing)

## Steps

- 1. No need to thaw the Bang Bang Shrimp; directly deep-fry in an oil pot at 170â„ƒ for 8 minutes. (Note: This method ensures a crispy exterior without prior defrosting, typical for frozen pre-marinated shrimp in quick-fry preparations.)
