## Ingredients:

- Papaya
- Rock sugar
- Dried tangerine peel
- Osmanthus flowers

## Steps:

- 1. Prepare sugar syrup for 10 portions: Add 750g water and 125g rock sugar to a pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low heat and simmer for 5 minutes; set aside.
- 2. Spread 8g of dried tangerine peel shreds evenly at the bottom of a clay pot, add 160g papaya chunks, pour in 50g sugar syrup, bring to a boil, then cook for 3 minutes; garnish with osmanthus flowers and serve.

*Note: Dried tangerine peel (chenpi) is a traditional Chinese ingredient that adds a citrusy, aromatic flavor; it can be found in Asian markets or online. The clay pot helps retain moisture and infuse flavors during gentle simmering.*
