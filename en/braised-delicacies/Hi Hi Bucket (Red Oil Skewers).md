## Ingredients

- Bobo Chicken Red Oil (Sichuan pepper oil, chili oil, chili, etc.)
- Bobo Chicken Broth Base (Both the Bobo Chicken Red Oil and Broth Base are from Chengdu Sheng'en)
- White Sesame Seeds
- Bobo Chicken Skewers (Chicken wing tips, beef, chicken, Chinese sausage, tofu puffs, kelp, king oyster mushrooms, tofu skin sheets, wood ear mushrooms, tofu skin) (From Hangzhou Xi Niu Ge)

## Steps

- 1. Bobo Chicken Broth Base: Add 2000g water to a pot, then add 320g Bobo Chicken Broth Base, 450g Bobo Chicken Red Oil, and 60g white sesame seeds. Stir evenly and set aside;
- 2. Blanch the thawed 10 skewers of Bobo Chicken skewers in boiling water for 1 minute 30 seconds (blanching helps remove excess moisture and impurities while partially cooking the ingredients);
- 3. Soak the skewers in the Bobo Chicken broth base, bring to a boil over low heat, then simmer for 5 minutes (simmering allows the flavors to infuse deeply into the skewers).
