## Ingredients
- Shanghai greens
- Soybean oil
- Rendered lard
- Garlic cloves
- Salt
- Chicken essence

## Steps
- 1. Add 80g soybean oil, 80g rendered lard, and 60g garlic cloves; stir-fry until fragrant.
- 2. Add 1300g Shanghai greens, 12g chicken essence, and 12g salt; stir-fry vigorously over high heat for 3 minutes and serve.

*Note: "Stir-fried until fragrant" refers to the initial high-heat saut√©ing to release aromas from the oil, fat, and garlic. The final step uses intense, quick stir-frying to preserve the greens' crisp texture without overcooking.*
