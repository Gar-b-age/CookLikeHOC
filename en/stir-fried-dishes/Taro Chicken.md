## Steps

### Chicken Preparation:
- 1. Add 350g rapeseed oil, 200g lard, and 3200g chicken pieces (cleaned and drained of moisture) to the wok; stir-fry until the surface is slightly golden. *(Note: Rapeseed oil is used here for its high smoke point, ideal for initial high-heat frying to render fat and crisp the chicken skin.)*
- 2. Add 50g scallions, 140g ginger, and 200g garlic; stir-fry until fragrant.
- 3. Add 800g fat intestine chicken sauce; stir-fry evenly to coat.
- 4. Add 3000g water, 40g salt, and 60g chicken bouillon powder; simmer for 2 minutes, then remove from heat. Reserve the chicken pieces and broth.

### Side Vegetable Preparation:
- 1. Add an appropriate amount of water and salt to the pot; bring to a boil, then add the vegetables.
- 2. Bring to a boil again and cook for 1 minute; remove and rinse under cold water. Reserve. *(Note: This blanching step preserves the vegetables' color and texture while removing any bitterness, making them ready for quick reheating in the final dish.)*

### Taro Chicken Assembly:
- 1. Soak 50g glass noodles until softened; blanch 60g potato slices and 80g asparagus lettuce slices for 20 seconds, drain, and arrange on a serving plate.
- 2. In the wok, add 200g cooked chicken pieces, 70g taro chunks, 250g broth, and 50g pickle; simmer for 3 minutes.
- 3. Add 8g line peppers, 5g fresh red millet peppers, 10g sesame oil, and 5g Sichuan peppercorn oil; continue simmering for 1 minute, then turn off heat and pour over the plate.
- 4. Heat 20g soybean oil; add 2g dried green Sichuan peppercorns and 5g dried red chili segments; fry until the numbing-spicy aroma is released, then evenly drizzle over the dish. *(Note: This final tempering infuses the oil with ma la (numbing and spicy) flavors from the peppercorns and chilies, enhancing the dish's signature Sichuan heat.)*
- 5. Garnish with 5g white sesame seeds and 5g cilantro segments. Serve.
