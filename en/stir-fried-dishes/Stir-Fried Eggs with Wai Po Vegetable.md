- 2. Add 20g soybean oil, 20g fresh red millet peppers, and 200g green peas, stir-fry to release the aroma;
- 3. Add 1000g Wai Po vegetable, 25g chicken essence, and 40g light soy sauce, stir-fry vigorously over high heat for 2 minutes;
- 4. Add the egg slices, stir-fry evenly to combine, and serve.

### Explanation of the Cooking Process
This recipe follows a classic stir-fry technique common in Hunan cuisine, starting with frying the eggs separately to achieve fluffy slices before incorporating them into the vegetable base. The high-heat stir-frying (爆炒) in step 3 ensures quick cooking while preserving the crispness of the Wai Po vegetable and infusing flavors from the seasonings. Note that "Wai Po vegetable" refers to a specific leafy green from Hunan, often with a slightly bitter taste, and "chicken essence" is a seasoning powder similar to MSG for umami enhancement. All quantities are scaled for a large batch, suitable for restaurant-style preparation.
