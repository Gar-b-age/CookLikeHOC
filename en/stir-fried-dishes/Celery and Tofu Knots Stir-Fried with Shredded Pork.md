## Ingredients
- Celery
- Tofu knots
- Marinated pork shreds (pork butt, salt, dark soy sauce, soybean oil, etc.) (Sliced and tumbled by Home Original Chicken Central Kitchen; detailed ingredients and ratios not officially disclosed by Home Original Chicken, please adjust according to personal taste)
- Red pepper
- Soybean oil
- Salt

## Steps
- 1. Add 150g soybean oil and 350g marinated pork shreds, stir-fry until the pork shreds change color;  
  *(Note: This initial stir-frying with oil helps to render fat from the pork and prevents sticking, ensuring even cooking.)*
- 2. Add 5g dark soy sauce, stir-fry until the pork shreds are colored;  
  *(Note: Dark soy sauce adds depth of color and a subtle umami flavor to the meat.)*
- 3. Finally, add 1000g celery, 500g tofu knots, 60g red pepper, 15g salt, and 10g chicken essence; stir-fry over high heat for 2 minutes and serve.  
  *(Note: High-heat stir-frying preserves the crispness of the celery and integrates flavors quickly without overcooking the vegetables.)*
