## Ingredients
- Celtuce (stem lettuce)
- Eggs
- Soybean oil
- Salt
- Chicken bouillon powder (or MSG seasoning)

## Steps
- 1. Pour 200g of soybean oil into the wok and heat it up, then stir-fry 600g of egg mixture until it forms scrambled egg pieces; remove from the wok and set aside for later use;
- 2. Add 50g of soybean oil, 1300g of celtuce strips, 15g of salt, and 10g of chicken bouillon powder to the wok; stir-fry vigorously over high heat until the celtuce strips are cooked through and no longer raw (断生: a Chinese cooking term meaning the ingredients lose their raw taste and are fully heated);
- 3. Add the scrambled egg pieces, stir-fry evenly, and serve.
