## Ingredients

- Broccoli
- Soy sauce

## Steps

1. Take 170g of broccoli and blanch it in boiling water for 60 seconds;  
   *(Note: Blanching involves briefly scalding the broccoli in boiling water to preserve its color and texture, then typically shocking it in cold water to stop the cooking processâ€”though not specified here, this is a common practice for crisp results.)*

2. Place the blanched broccoli in a serving dish and drizzle with 30g of soy sauce to serve.
