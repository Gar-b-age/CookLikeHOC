## Ingredients

- Small yellow millet
- Diced pumpkin

## Steps

- 1. Rinse and drain 300g of small yellow millet;
- 2. Place 400g of diced pumpkin and 4600g of water into a stainless steel bucket, bring to a boil over high heat, then add the rinsed small yellow millet, stir evenly, and simmer for 40 minutes until ready to serve.

**Note on cooking technique:** "Simmer" here refers to slow cooking over low heat after boiling (熬制), which allows the millet to soften and absorb the flavors from the pumpkin and water, resulting in a smooth, nutritious porridge. The large amount of water (4600g) suggests this yields a thin, soupy consistency typical of some Chinese porridges.
