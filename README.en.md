As of the submission, the only relationship between the contributors and HOC is that of consumers and merchants. This repository is not the official repository of HOC.

Regarding the reason why the repository name is `CookLikeHOC`, because writing _Laoxiangji_ might pose readability issues for some, and Home Original Chicken is the English name used in China Daily's report on _Laoxiangji_ , hence abbreviated as HOC.
